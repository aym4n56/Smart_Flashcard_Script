This project will allow the user to create flashcards.

The flashcards will be set to allow answers with a 0.7 similarity threshold

If the user says their answer is correct after the program says it is wrong the similarity threshold will be adjusted.

The program will compare to all correct answers and incorrect answers in the database, using the similarity threshold and then it will calculate the average of how similar they are to the correct and incorrect answers. 

If it is more similar to the corrrect answers it will be deemed as correct.

If it is more similar to the incorrect answers it will be deemed as incorrect.

Run Program and follow intrcutions.
